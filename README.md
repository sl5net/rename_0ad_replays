# rename_0ad_replays
this renames the replay folder names

## install

You need a Kotlin compiler and runtime environment (JRE) installed. The easiest way to get this is to use the Kotlin command-line compiler ( kotlinc ) which is part of the Kotlin SDK.

 SDKMAN! is a version manager that makes installing and managing SDKs (including Kotlin) very easy on Linux, macOS, and similar systems.

*   **Install SDKMAN!** (If you don't already have it)
```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"  # Or follow the instructions printed by the installer
```

*   **Install Kotlin:**
```bash
sdk install kotlin
```

*   **Verify Installation:**
```bash
kotlin -version
```

```bash
kotlinc ...
```
This should print the Kotlin version.

compile example(you dont need to to it later again):
```bash
~/.local/share/0ad/replays/0.27.0$ clear; kotlinc rename_0ad_replays_a27.kt -include-runtime -d rename_0ad_replays_a27.jar
```

run example:
```bash
java -jar rename_0ad_replays_a27.jar
```


## save it in already existing replays folder (workd for a24)

for example:

~/snap/0ad/206/.local/share/0ad/replays/0.0.24

rename in script 

0ad/239

to your version

for example

0ad/242

## setpath0

search for and change this:

$path0 = '/home/x/snap/0ad/206/.local/share/0ad/replays/0.0.242/';

uncoment 

//$doRenameAll = true;

if you want.

folder name before:

needs nodejs. example install for ubuntu v20.4
